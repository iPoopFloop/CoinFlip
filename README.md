# CoinFlip
This is a Coin Flip plugin created for Pocketmine-MP servers. 

Command - /coinflip | Whenever you type this command a form will appear asking how much you'd like to bet on the coinflip, once you've
selected the amount and clicked the "Submit." button the plugin will automatically "flip a coin" and decide if the player won or lost
(doubled what he put in or lost it all).

# Required
EconomyAPI is required for this plugin to load.

This is my first plugin I've made so please do not freak out if you find errors or bugs, just simply leave an issue in this Git and
I will fix it as soon as I can.
